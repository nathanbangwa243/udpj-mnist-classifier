## MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving a high level of accuracy.

**Key Features:**

* Efficient training process with clear visualization of training progress (loss and accuracy).
* Well-structured code for easy understanding and modification.
* Leverages PyTorch and torchvision libraries for deep learning tasks.

**Getting Started**

This project is designed to be readily used and explored. The code is well-documented and the required libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib) are typically found in most deep learning environments.

**Results and Visualization**

The project trains the model and generates plots to visualize the training process:

* **Training Loss:** Shows the average loss per epoch, indicating how well the model learns over time.
* **Training Accuracy:** Depicts the average training accuracy per epoch, demonstrating the model's ability to correctly classify digits.
